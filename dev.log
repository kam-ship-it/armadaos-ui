(node:6142) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///home/ubuntu/armadaos-ui/postcss.config.js?t=1766963335702 is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /home/ubuntu/armadaos-ui/package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
